EPX files are a form of uncompressed images used by EPixel. The file format is very basic and includes no metadata.
Every pixel is stored as RGBA values from 0 to 255. Each value in the pixel is separated by a comma. After the color data,
the plus (+) symbol is used to mark the end of the pixel.
The end of a line of pixels is marked with the minus (-) symbol.
